## Demonstrable Skills
‚Ä¢	Apply if, else if, and else statements to handle different gameplay scenarios (e.g., basic hit, critical hit, knockout) to exemplify understanding of conditional branching
‚Ä¢	By using conditionals to determine game outcomes and player health status, students will problem-solve and troubleshoot their projects to create functional gameplay via the VSCode terminal
 
## Overall Gameplay
Below is an explanation of how the game works. It will breakdown how the hits are delivered and how each hit differs in the damage delivered.
‚Ä¢	Players take turns delivering damage to their opponent. Damage is randomly set between 1 and 10 points.
‚Ä¢	Basic Hit: Damage less than 6.
‚Ä¢	Critical Hit: Damage between 6 and 9 (inclusive).
‚Ä¢	Knockout: Damage equal to 10.
‚Ä¢	If either player's health drops to 0 or below, they are knocked out, and the game ends.
## Gameplay Sequence
Below is the sequence of events you should see emulated in your boxing game. We use this logic to determine the direction our code should go in. This would be a good example of developing pseudo code before jumping into our scripts.
1. Check whose turn it is to determine who is taking damage
2. Set damage to a random number
3. Check what category the damage falls under
4. Reduce damage the player receiving the hit
5. Check their health at its current state to determine a knockout
6. Switch player turns
 
## Expected Output
When the program runs, it alternates hits between the two boxers, displaying the results of each hit until one boxer is knocked out. Below you can see the desired output you should find in your VSCode terminal.

Starting the Boxing Game!
Player 1 vs Player 2
Player 1 lands a critical hit on Player 2!
Player 2's health is now 93.
It's now Player 2's turn.
Player 2 lands a basic hit on Player 1!
Player 1's health is now 97.
It's now Player 1's turn.
Player 1 lands a basic hit on Player 2!
Player 2's health is now 92.
It's now Player 2's turn.
Player 2 lands a basic hit on Player 1!
Player 1's health is now 93.
It's now Player 1's turn.
Player 1 lands a KNOCKOUT on Player 2!ü•ä
Player 2's health is now 0.
Player 2 has been knocked out!
Player 1 is the WINNER! üèÜ
 
## Instructions
### File/Environment Setup
1.	Create a JavaScript file called `boxing.js` in your `week3` directory
2.	Open up the file in VSCode, all the code in this assignment will be added the `boxing.js`
   
### Setting Up the Boxers Using JavaScript Objects
1.	Each group should create two boxers with starting health points and Name.
o	What data structure would help us accomplish this? We need some sort of container that will allow us to add properties such as name and health points.
o	An object is the best data structure to store multiple key value pairs to one collection. Below we created two object for each respective boxer
2.	Create a variable called `currentPlayer` and set it to your `player1` object

### Create a Function for Hits
1.	Copy the code below to `boxing.js` this function will allow us to generate a random damage amount.

### Categorize Damage and Update Player‚Äôs Health By Creating Functions
The applyDamage function simulates a player attacking their opponent with a certain amount of damage. It checks the damage value to categorize the hit as a basic hit, critical hit, or knockout, and then reduces the opponent's health accordingly. If the damage is 10 (a knockout), the opponent's health is set to 0, and the game considers them knocked out.
1.	Copy and paste the applyDamage function into your `boxing.js` file, underneath the generateDamage function
2.	Use a conditional operator to fill out the missing conditional statements in the function below to determine what level of hit the opponent received (refer to overall game play for the rules). Use the word damage to create your conditional statements
3.	Finish this conditional statement: opponent.health < 0 || /* fill conditional here */
i.	In what other situation do we want to set the opponent automatically to 0?Use the word damage to finish the conditional statement 

üõë Recap: So far, we've set up our boxers and assigned Player 1 to go first. We then created a function to generate a random number between 1 and 10 to represent the damage. After generating the damage, we built an applyDamage function that logs the type of hit (basic, critical, or knockout), updates the opponent's health, and ensures the opponent's health is set to 0 if a knockout occurs.

## 4. Check if opponent‚Äôs health is 0
‚Ä¢	Copy and paste the checkKnockout function into your `boxing.js` file, underneath the applyDamage function
‚Ä¢	Add the missing conditional below (hint : use dot notation to access the opponent‚Äôs health)

## 5. Adding Game play Logic
‚Ä¢	At this point, managing game state, looping, and variable reassignment has not been covered. Below are the rest of the functions need to complete the boxing game. Copy and paste the functions below into your `boxing.js` file, underneath the checkKnockout function
Let‚Äôs take a look at what the main purpose of each function below is:
switchTurns() manages alternating turns between players.
playTurn() controls each turn, including generating damage, applying it, checking for a knockout, and switching turns.
startGame() begins the game, running the game loop until a knockout occurs, then ending the game with a message.

## 6. Run the Game
Open up your terminal in VSCode and run the following command:

node boxing.js
